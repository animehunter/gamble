HMC - Harmonic Monte Carlo

The usual database of random choices is now thought of as
the "position" of a particle and an auxiliary normally
distributed "momentum" random variable is added such that the
quantity:
  H(x,p) = U(x) + K(p)
is conserved.  Where U(x) is the "potential energy" of the position
and K(p) is the "kinetic energy" of the momentum.

;; populate the random choice DB and return a (non-stochastic) answer thunk
;; which closed over the random variables (ie the DB) of the definition.
