Tentative plans for the near future:

- fix contract sites

- catch up on docs, tests

- custom proposals that use info from trace (via labels??)

- sort out labels vs zones (more changes to entry, db-ctx)
  - I think labels should be unique, maybe replace addresses 
    when available. Zones nest, like Venture's "scope-include".
  - attach special conditions and derivatives to labels

- weighted-sampler -> sampler via sampling-importance-resampling
  - Sean is skeptical of my plans :(
    incremental sampling (as opposed to "take N samples and done") seems hard
- slice sampling
- simulated annealing
- calculate effective sample size
  - typically for SMC, but maybe also for importance sampler?
- evidence softening

Longer term:

- avoid running entire program to recompute trace
  (cf Venture scaffolds ??, Church tracing and slicing ??)
  - note, in some contexts don't even need to update final value!
    - eg internal HMC leapfrog steps
    - eg slice sampling slice-bounds-finding

- specialize possible operations on prob models (?):
  - sample
  - expectation
  - MAP, general argmax probability
    - argmax over {all latent vars} vs {subset of latent vars}
    - gradient-descent methods
  - (marginal) probability
    - at point (density estimation?)
    - of predicate/event
    - special cases of expectations

- modules/models
  - represent with semi-AST to capture known structure
    - hybrid interpretation/compilation
    - maybe run-time codegen to specialize execution
    - analytic methods (collapsing, conjugacy, etc)
  - probably want to avoid separate-compilation-induced problems 
    as much as possible

- testing and diagnostics

- more diagnostics:
  - MH: % of steps that used custom proposal vs resample

----

use entropy (or entropy rate) as diagnostic
  - indicates "goodness"/"peakedness" of posterior
  - how to estimate in general?

detect special classes of models to apply specialized techniques
  - examples?
