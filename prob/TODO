Tentative plans for the near future:

- add ll to entry
- compute MH ratio components incrementally
- catch up on docs, tests

- sort out labels vs zones (more changes to entry, db-ctx)
  - I think labels should be unique, maybe replace addresses 
    when available. Zones nest, like Venture's "scope-include".
  - attach MH custom proposals to zones
  - attach special conditions and derivatives to labels

- weighted-sampler -> sampler via sampling-importance-resampling
- multi-variable MH via zones
- slice sampling
- simulated annealing
- calculate effective sample size
  - typically for SMC, but maybe also for importance sampler?

Longer term:

- avoid running entire program to recompute trace
  (cf Venture scaffolds ??, Church tracing and slicing ??)
  - note, in some contexts don't even need to update final value!
    - eg internal HMC leapfrog steps
    - eg slice sampling slice-bounds-finding

- specialize possible operations on prob models (?):
  - sample
  - expectation
  - MAP, general argmax probability
    - gradient-descent methods
  - probability at point (density estimation?)
  - probability of predicate/event

- modules/models
  - represent with semi-AST to capture known structure
    - hybrid interpretation/compilation
    - maybe run-time codegen to specialize execution
    - analytic methods (collapsing, conjugacy, etc)
  - probably want to avoid separate-compilation-induced problems 
    as much as possible

- testing and diagnostics
